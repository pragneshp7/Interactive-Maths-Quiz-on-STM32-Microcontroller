# Interactive Maths Quiz on STM32 Microcontroller
Developed a quizzing system using LCD Display, Random Number Generator, Flash Memory, Timers on STM32 Microcontroller and interfaced it with a Keyboard and Buzzer. The Keyboard was interfaced using USB and the Buzzer was interfaced through GPIO pins. The Random Number Generator was used to generate the quiz questions and the Flash Memory was used to store the usernames and high scores. The Keyboard.c file contains the frontend code of the system.

There are 2 modes namely, Test and Practice. The test mode questions will have a timer and the highest scores will be stored in memory along with the names. You can use the key 'r' to restart. The high scores can be viewed using the 'h' key and cleared from the memory if required using the 'f' key.

The following link has a demo of the quizzing system - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UQFL-V8wUi1P7bC8urDvEHGSN9agHiZc/view
